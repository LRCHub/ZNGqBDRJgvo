You try to run me through
Hold on, think again
Don't you know
What you're starting?

But, you sure ain't got a clue
How bad this will go
Don't you know, know my art?
(Art of war)

And as you look to the horizon, not a cloud
But then stormy weather's caught you cold
Seems like it crept up out of nowhere all around you
It's not quite what you foretold

You'll never see it coming
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
You're done in
By the time it's hit you, your last surprise

You think you got your game planned out to a T
Yet I'm two steps ahead, yeah
So, you step into my way, stand down, it's a trap
One more step and you're dead (yeah, you're dead)

Why, just a picosecond ago, clear blue skies
But now lightning's struck your last resolve
It's not an accident that no one hears your cries
As your last strength seems to dissolve

You'll never see it coming
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
You're done in
By the time it's hit you, your last surprise

I'm coming for you
My game's always so fast, so fine
You're spun in by the net
You didn't catch it in time

Better think about your game
Are you sure your next move's the right one for you?
Are you sure you won't get outmaneuvered
Again and again, my friend?

You'll never see it coming
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
You're done in
By the time it's hit you, your last surprise

I'm coming for you
My game's always so fast, so fine
You're spun in by the net
You didn't catch it in time
